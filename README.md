# Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

**What is it:** IaC is a method of managing and provisioning computing infrastructure through machine-readable definition files, rather than physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools.

**Why use it:** It ensures consistent and repeatable routines for provisioning and tearing down infrastructure, reducing manual processes, and enhancing the speed and reliability of infrastructure deployments.

**When to use it:** Use IaC when you need to automate the setup, change, or removal of infrastructure, especially in environments that change often or are scaled frequently.

**Where to use it:** IaC is utilized in cloud environments, data centers, and anywhere infrastructure needs to be managed as code. It is essential for DevOps practices, facilitating continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) workflows.

**Tools Available:**

-   **Terraform:** Open-source tool that works with many cloud providers for infrastructure provisioning.
-   **Ansible:** Open-source tool for software provisioning, configuration management, and application deployment.
-   **Chef:** Provides a way to define infrastructure as code to automate server configuration and management.
-   **Puppet:** Manages infrastructure as code, automating the provisioning, configuration, and management of servers.
-   **AWS CloudFormation:** Service for AWS users to define and provision AWS infrastructure using code.

### Ansible

**What is Ansible:** Ansible is an open-source automation tool for software provisioning, configuration management, and application deployment. It uses YAML syntax for expressing automation jobs in plain terms.

**Benefits of using Ansible:**

-   **Simplicity:** Easy to learn and use because of its use of YAML for defining automation jobs.
-   **Agentless:** Does not require any agent software installed on remote nodes, making it easier to manage.
-   **Efficiency:** Uses SSH for communication with no extra servers or daemons needed, reducing the overhead on the network.
-   **Flexibility:** Can manage both Unix-like systems and Windows systems from a single control machine.

**Who is using IaC and Ansible:**
Many organisations across various industries use IaC and Ansible for automating their infrastructure management, including tech giants, startups, and government agencies. Companies like NASA, Twitter, and many others have publicly shared their use of Ansible for automating deployment, configuration management, and ensuring consistent environments across development, testing, and production.
